# Hi I’m Nicole, a Frontend Devloper at [Findaway](findaway.com)!
**Findaway** is an audio technology company — innovating every day to bring more audiobooks to more listeners around the globe.<br/> I love what I do and the company I get to do it for!

My responsibility is to work with our Dev team to maintain responsive sites & applications built with CRA, Gatsby, or vanilla JS. <br/>
Utilizing our Web Dev Team's Front-End Boilerplate [Solon](https://github.com/FindawayWorld/solon), we get sites up and running quickly!

To name a few latest rebuilds: 
* [Playaway Marketing site](playaway.com)
* [Audioworks Marketing site](findawayaudioworks.com)
* [Audioengine Marketing site](audioengine.io)
